# Project_management

This organization is used for managing Vilniaus Jono Basanaviƒçiaus Gimnazijos development projects.
</br>
If you want to contribute to any of the organizations repositories,
first you need to be a student of VJBG,
second of all, contact the owner of the repo you want to contribute to.
</br>
Every repo should have a CI/CD github actions workflow.
That would allow automated contributions.
